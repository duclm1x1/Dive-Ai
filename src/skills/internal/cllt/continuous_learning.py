Continuous Learning with Long-Term Memory
Part of Dive Coder v19.3 - Phase 3


Implement Continuous Learning Engine with:
- store_experience(task, result, feedback)
- retrieve_similar(task, k=5) -> List[Experience]
- consolidate_memory()
- forget_irrelevant(threshold)
Test cases: store 1000 experiences, consolidate 100 to 10, forget 20%, improve performance
