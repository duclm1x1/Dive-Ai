Root cause: Insufficient buffer sizing algorithm, race conditions in buffer access. Fix: Implement lock-free ring buffer with atomic operations, add predictive buffer sizing based on historical patterns, implement overflow prevention with backpressure mechanism, add comprehensive unit tests.

      "input": "Issue #10 FINAL FIX: Conversation state persistence memory - Currently 3.83GB peak memory vs 2GB target. Root cause: Inefficient state serialization, no compression, large conversation history retention. Fix: Implement state compression (zlib/lz4), add conversation history pruning with importance scoring, use memory-mapped files for large states, implement incremental state updates instead of full saves, add memory profiling and optimization. Target: <2GB peak memory, 99.9% persistence. File: core/conversation/state_manager.py",
