# Scorecard (Evidence-backed)

Score each dimension 0–5. Total /25.

1) Correctness (tests + invariants)
2) Security (scans + secrets + tenancy isolation)
3) Reliability (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, idempotency)
4) Observability (logs/metrics/traces + dashboards + alerts)
5) Governance (baseline + SARIF + EvidencePack + claims)

**Evidence rule:** any score ≥4 must be backed by E2/E3 evidence.
