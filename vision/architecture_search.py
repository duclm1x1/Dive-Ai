Dynamic Neural Architecture Search
Part of Dive Coder v19.3 - Phase 2


Implement DNAS Engine with:
- search_architecture(task, constraints) -> Architecture
- generate_code(architecture, framework) -> str
- estimate_performance(architecture) -> PerformanceMetrics
Test cases: image classification, NLP task, PyTorch code generation
