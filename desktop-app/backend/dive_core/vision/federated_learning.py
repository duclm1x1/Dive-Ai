Federated Expert Learning
Part of Dive Coder v19.3 - Phase 3


Implement Federated Learning Engine with:
- train_local(local_data) -> ModelUpdate
- aggregate_updates(updates) -> GlobalModel
- apply_differential_privacy(update, epsilon) -> ModelUpdate
- verify_contribution(instance_id) -> ContributionMetrics
Test cases: 3 local datasets, differential privacy ε=1.0, contribution tracking, 90% accuracy
