# Trail of Bits: sharp-edges

**Repo:** https://github.com/trailofbits/sharp-edges

**Type:** security-knowledge-base

## Why this is useful
Catalog of dangerous APIs/configs; great source for “policy” rules.

## How to integrate with Antigravity + Vibe
Translate items into rule packs (high confidence) with evidence anchors.

## Recommended usage pattern
- Treat this as an **optional skill module**.
- If it introduces lint/test/security outputs, wire it into Vibe **Gates** and export **SARIF/Markdown**.
