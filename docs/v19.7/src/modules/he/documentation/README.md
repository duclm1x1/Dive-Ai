_# HE - Hierarchical Experts Engine

**Version:** 2.0 (Upgraded from Orchestrator/Coder Structure)
**Status:** Active

## 1. Overview

The Hierarchical Experts (HE) Engine formalizes and extends the implicit hierarchy of the Dive Coder system. It organizes agents and skills into a multi-level hierarchy, with generalist agents at the top routing tasks to more specialized experts at lower levels. This creates a highly scalable and efficient system for tackling complex problems, breaking them down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.

## 2. Core Functionality

- **Hierarchy Definition:** A flexible system for defining the hierarchical relationships between different agents and skills.
- **Task Decomposition:** A top-level agent that receives a complex task and breaks it down into a sequence of sub-tasks to be executed by specialized experts.
- **Multi-Level Routing:** A routing mechanism that operates at each level of the hierarchy, ensuring that sub-tasks are always sent to the most appropriate expert.
- **Knowledge Aggregation:** A bottom-up process for aggregating the results and knowledge generated by lower-level experts into a coherent, final solution.

## 3. Integration with Dive Engine

The HE Engine is a core architectural pattern within the Dive Engine, working closely with the Semantic Routing (SR) engine. It provides the fundamental structure for organizing the system's expertise and is a key enabler of Dive Coder's ability to handle large-scale, complex software development projects.
