# /vibe-skills

Purpose: discover external skill packs and decide which ones to import into the current repo.

Instructions:
1) Open `.agent/skills/vibe-external-skills-catalog.md`.
2) Pick 1–3 entries that match the current task (React/Next, Nest, Tailwind, QA, Docs, Security).
3) If using `vercel-labs/add-skill`, run it in a controlled way (respect repo policy) to import the selected skill notes.
4) Re-run `/vibe-review` to ensure changes remain enterprise-grade.
