## Part 1: Understanding the Compute Economy

### Why Compute is Becoming Currency

**Traditional Money Problems:**
- Backed by government (centralized)
- No intrinsic value
- Slow transactions
- Can be printed infinitely

**Compute Advantages:**
- Backed by real hardware (decentralized)
- Directly useful (run AI, ML, simulations)
- Instant global transfer
- Limited by Moore's Law (scarce)
- Fungible and divisible
- Verifiable and transparent

### The Compute Value Chain

```
Hardware Manufacturers (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)
        ↓ (30% margin)
Data Center Operators (AWS, Azure, Google)
        ↓ (40% margin)
Compute Brokers/Marketplaces
        ↓ (15% margin)
End Users (AI Companies, Researchers)
```

**Opportunity:** Each layer captures 15-40% margin. Total market = $470B.
