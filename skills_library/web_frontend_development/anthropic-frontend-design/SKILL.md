# Frontend Design

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme direction—brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Implementation Standards

Implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Typography

- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- **AVOID**: Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts (generic AI slop)
- **USE**: Unexpected, characterful font choices
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font
- Example sources: Google Fonts (avoid overused ones), Adobe Fonts, custom fonts

### Color & Theme

- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- **AVOID**: Purple gradients on white (cliched AI aesthetic)
- **USE**: Context-specific color schemes that match the tone

### Motion & Animation

- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition

- Create unexpected layouts
- Use asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Include grid-breaking elements
- Balance generous negative space OR controlled density (intentional choice)

### Backgrounds & Visual Details

Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic:

- Gradient meshes
- Noise textures
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors
- Grain overlays

## Critical Rules

### NEVER Use Generic AI Aesthetics

- ❌ Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- ❌ Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- ❌ Predictable layouts and component patterns
- ❌ Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

### ALWAYS Vary Across Generations

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between:

- Light and dark themes
- Different fonts
- Different aesthetics
- NEVER converge on common choices (e.g., Space Grotesk) across generations

### Match Implementation Complexity to Vision

**Maximalist designs**: Need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects

**Minimalist/refined designs**: Need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details

**Remember**: Elegance comes from executing the vision well, regardless of complexity level.

## Philosophy

Claude (and all AI agents) are capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## Examples of Aesthetic Directions

- **Brutally Minimal**: Monochrome, extreme white space, sparse typography, single focal point
- **Maximalist Chaos**: Overlapping elements, dense information, vibrant colors, pattern mixing
- **Retro-Futuristic**: Chrome effects, neon accents, geometric shapes, 80s-inspired gradients
- **Organic/Natural**: Earth tones, flowing shapes, texture overlays, handwritten fonts
- **Luxury/Refined**: Gold accents, serif fonts, generous spacing, subtle animations
- **Playful/Toy-like**: Rounded corners, bright pastels, bouncy animations, fun icons
- **Editorial/Magazine**: Grid-based, bold headlines, photo-heavy, clean hierarchy
- **Brutalist/Raw**: Exposed structure, monospace fonts, harsh contrasts, intentional "ugly"
- **Art Deco/Geometric**: Sharp angles, metallic accents, symmetry, ornate borders
- **Soft/Pastel**: Muted colors, soft shadows, gentle curves, calm atmosphere
- **Industrial/Utilitarian**: Concrete textures, stencil fonts, functional aesthetics, raw materials

Each project should commit to ONE direction and execute it fully—no half measures.
